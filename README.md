# Nimet

This webapp has names.json saved in its data folder. It only has one module and data service. The data service GETs the contents of names.json using GetAllObjects() function. The results of this data service are used in app.component.ts where they are saved as nameObjectsList using ngOnInit() lifecycle hook. Now they can be used in the view part of the app, app.component.html, which displays the contents of names.json using certain simple controls: searching for a specific name, viewing amount of all people with these names and displaying all names in a table sorted by amount of names or alphabetical order. The layout of the page is done using Bootstrap styles. What I could improve still is making the search box cooler (displaying more alternatives for search results during the search).
